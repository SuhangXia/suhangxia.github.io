Currently, I am an **MSc Robotics student at King's College London (KCL)**, where I am privileged to be supervised by **[Dr. Shan Luo](https://shanluo.github.io/)**. My current research interests focus on **Vision-Tactile-Language-Action (VTLA)** models and their applications in robotic manipulation, such as robotic cloth sorting.

Before joining KCL, I served as an **Algorithm Engineer at [Hangzhou Lancet Robotics company LTD, China](https://www.lancet-robotics.com/sy)**, a high-tech company specializing in the development of surgical robots. In this role, I focused on designing and optimizing algorithms to enhance the precision and functionality of robotic systems used in medical applications. 

Prior to my professional career, I dedicated my graduation research project to an indoor navigation system based on the **EGO-Planner**. This project involved exploring real-time navigation technologies for UAVs in complex indoor environments under the guidance of **[Prof. Yunpu Song](https://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-BE75CP8J)**.
