Currently, I am a Robotic Arm Algorithm Engineer at [Hangzhou Lancet Robotics company LTD, China](https://www.lancet-robotics.com/sy), a high-tech company specializing in the development of surgical robots. In this role, I focus on designing and optimizing algorithms to enhance the precision and functionality of robotic systems used in medical applications. Prior to this, I earned my undergraduate degree in Mechatronic Engineering from [Tongji Zhejiang College](https://www.tjzj.edu.cn/cn/index/index.html), where I dedicated my final project to researching an indoor navigation system based on the EGO-Planner. This project involved exploring real-time navigation technologies for UAVs in complex indoor environments under the guidance of [Prof. Yunpu Song](https://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-BE75CP8J).
