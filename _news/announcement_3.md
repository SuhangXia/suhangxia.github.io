This weekend, I joined the 14th DreamTown English Corner, and the topic this time was all about "Time Management" ⏰. The event took place at Momicafe, a cozy bookstore with a warm vibe, perfect for thoughtful discussions. This wasn’t just another language meetup—it felt more like a power-packed "brainstorming session" full of great ideas and perspectives!
