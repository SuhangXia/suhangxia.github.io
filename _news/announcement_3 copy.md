I’ve recently started a new chapter in my career, taking on the role of lead for robotic arm algorithm engineering at our newly established Shaoxing Xinchang branch. This state-of-the-art facility, spanning 5,000 square meters, serves as both an R&D and manufacturing hub for our surgical robotics innovations.

My primary focus here is driving the development of two cutting-edge surgical robots: a **lung biopsy robot** and a **neurosurgical robot**. Both projects represent exciting challenges with the potential to transform clinical practices, and I’m thrilled to contribute to their progress.

Meanwhile, the company continues to make significant strides, recently securing tens of millions of RMB in Series A funding, led by CICC Capital. This investment will accelerate the industrialization of our cross-specialty surgical robots, expand production, and strengthen our global presence.
