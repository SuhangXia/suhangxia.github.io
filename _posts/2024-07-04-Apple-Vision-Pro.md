The Apple Vision Pro delivers **stunning clarity**, easily the **highest resolution** I've ever experienced in a VR headsetâ€”**truly unmatched** in visual quality. However, it does come with a downside: it's **a bit on the heavy side**, and after extended use, it can cause some neck strain. Despite that, the visual experience is so immersive, it feels like a new standard for VR.
