This weekend, I joined the 14th DreamTown English Corner, and the topic this time was all about "Time Management" ⏰. The event took place at Momicafe, a cozy bookstore with a warm vibe, perfect for thoughtful discussions. This wasn’t just another language meetup—it felt more like a power-packed "brainstorming session" full of great ideas and perspectives!

We kicked off with a fun icebreaker game, "Who’s the Spy?" 🕵️‍♂️, which got everyone comfortable and ready to chat.

Then, we split into small groups to dive into some meaningful questions around time management, such as:

- What are the biggest challenges in time management? 🕑
- How can we avoid procrastination and stay efficient? 🚀
- Are there any specific techniques that work well for you? 📋
- How does stress impact time management, and how can we handle it? 💆‍♀️
- How can we stop multitasking and focus better? 🔍

One of the highlights was definitely meeting some really interesting people! I sat next to an experienced architect from Alibaba, who shared some practical time management tips from his job. I also connected with a data scientist (also from Alibaba!) who relies on precise time allocation and introduced us to the “Pomodoro Technique”—definitely taking notes on that! 📈 Alongside them, there was an English teacher, an immigration officer from China’s visa department, and an auditor from ShineWing. The diversity of backgrounds made our discussions incredibly rich and insightful.

Finally, each group created a time management plan for a hypothetical "newbie" named George 🧑‍💼, with two representatives from each team presenting the ideas. The open Q&A made it even more interactive and engaging!

Overall, it was a perfect blend of language practice and practical life insights! I’m really looking forward to the next session—can’t wait to catch up with everyone again and continue learning 🌟!
